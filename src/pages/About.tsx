            Welcome! I'm Evan â€” a front-end engineer who also happens to love
            books, photography, and basketball. This site started as a quick
            experiment when I was considering new opportunities this September,
            but I think I'll keep it going.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not working or tinkering here, you'll probably find me
            exploring NYC's food scene, shooting hoops, or at a Nets or Liberty
            game.
