              <p>
                I was asked for an updated resume, so I decided to build a
                digital version of it and add a few other features. Now, it
                serves as a place for me to share what I've read, projects that
                I've worked on, some of my photography, and my resume. In the
                future, I plan to add a blog. You can view the source code for
